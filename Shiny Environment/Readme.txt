# this is a exciting but exhausted moment to write this doc
# after days and nights in Eng & Sci Library, final to this phrase
# Ming Li

# Except for the model part, I have accomplished all the analysis visualizations Panels
# Truthly enhanced my data manipulation skills and debug in R

## Download the package and extract all to one file folder
## open ui.R, server.R and global.R files
## setwd() to the file folder

### for older version of Rstudio, you need to run the global.R first to install the packages needed to run the app and help the IDE figure out it's a Shiny App
### then you will see a green "RUN APP" button available in the IDE

### for newer version of Rstudio, you can just click the "RUN APP" button and wait.

## I have try my best to optimize the program and use as less packages as possible.

## Hope you enjoy !
